		<p><div style="text-align:center">

</div><h3>OVERVIEW</h3><p>I want to map the mouse keys on my Microsoft Ergonomic Sculpt mouse that came with my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Desktop-L5V-00001/dp/B00CYX54C0/">Microsoft Sculpt Erconomic Keyboard</a>. Its a bit of an odd duck of a mouse. It is oddly shaped and a bit uncormforable to use. It is however less uncomfortable than my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB829Z-A-Magic-Mouse/dp/B002NX0M8C">Apple Magic Mouse</a>. </p><p>The main problem I have is that the Windows key does not work with on my Mac. I have found <a href="https://blog.yorkxin.org/posts/2014/04/12/microsoft-sculpt-mobile-mouse-and-mac/">this</a> blog post discussing how to fix it. Per the instructions I installed <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en">Karabiner</a> and after a little tinkering was able to map the Windows key to mouse button #5.</p><p>From there I used <a href="http://www.boastr.net/">bettertouchtool</a> to map both the thumb buttons to Expose and Mission Control switcher. Below is the private.xml I used in Karabiner. </p><p>The mouse is still a tad uncomfortable, but so far so good in terms of mapping the mouse buttons.</p><h3>PRIVATE.xml</h3>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;root&gt;

&lt;/deviceproductdef&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
&lt;name&gt;Windows Button to Mission Control (Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse)&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;identifier&gt;com.microsoft.mouse.sculpt_mobile.win_button&lt;/identifier&gt;

		<a href="blog/2015/casey-at-the-bat.html"><h1>There's Always Next Year / Casey at the Bat</h1></a>
		<p>21 October 2015</p>
		<p><p>It's been a while since I posted this. Usually its for my Red Sox. But I think its time I post it for my adopted city and the Cubbies.</p>
<blockquote><p>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;<br/>The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br/>And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br/>A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. </p><p>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br/>Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br/>They thought, 'If only Casey could but get a whack at that-<br/>We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.' </p><p>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br/>And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;<br/>So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br/>For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.</p><p>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br/>And Blake, the much despis√®d, tore the cover off the ball;<br/>And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,<br/>There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third. </p><p>Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;<br/>It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;<br/>It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br/>For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. </p><p>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br/>There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.<br/>And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br/>No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat. </p><p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br/>Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;<br/>Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br/>Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip. </p><p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br/>And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br/>Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped-<br/>'That ain't my style,' said Casey. 'Strike one! ' the umpire said. </p><p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br/>Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;<br/>'Kill him! Kill the umpire! ' shouted some one on the stand;<br/>And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. </p><p>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br/>He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br/>He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;<br/>But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, 'Strike two! ' </p><p>'Fraud! ' cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered 'Fraud! '<br/>But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.<br/>They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br/>And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again. </p><p>The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;<br/>He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br/>And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.<br/>And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow. </p><p>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;<br/>The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,<br/>And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout;<br/>But there is no joy in Mudville- mighty Casey has struck out. &gt; </p>
