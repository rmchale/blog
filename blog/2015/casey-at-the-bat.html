		<h1>There's Always Next Year / Casey at the Bat</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>21 October 2015</em></p>

	<p><p>It's been a while since I posted this. Usually its for my Red Sox. But I think its time I post it for my adopted city and the Cubbies.</p>
<blockquote><p>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;<br/>The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br/>And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br/>A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. </p><p>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br/>Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br/>They thought, 'If only Casey could but get a whack at that-<br/>We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.' </p><p>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br/>And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;<br/>So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br/>For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.</p><p>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br/>And Blake, the much despis√®d, tore the cover off the ball;<br/>And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,<br/>There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third. </p><p>Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;<br/>It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;<br/>It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br/>For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. </p><p>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br/>There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.<br/>And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br/>No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat. </p><p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br/>Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;<br/>Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br/>Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip. </p><p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br/>And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br/>Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped-<br/>'That ain't my style,' said Casey. 'Strike one! ' the umpire said. </p><p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br/>Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;<br/>'Kill him! Kill the umpire! ' shouted some one on the stand;<br/>And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. </p><p>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br/>He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br/>He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;<br/>But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, 'Strike two! ' </p><p>'Fraud! ' cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered 'Fraud! '<br/>But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.<br/>They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br/>And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again. </p><p>The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;<br/>He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br/>And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.<br/>And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow. </p><p>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;<br/>The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,<br/>And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout;<br/>But there is no joy in Mudville- mighty Casey has struck out. &gt; </p>
